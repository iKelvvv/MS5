# E-Commerce Store

## Introduction

Welcome to my fifth project. This project is an e-commerce store for steak lovers. Users will be able to purchase steaks and steak related equipment from this website. This project will use languages and frameworks such as Django, Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The admin of the website will also be have the ability to use all CRUD funtionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

# 1. UX

[Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

As a massive fan of steak, I have always experimented with buying steaks online. There are multiple methods that I use when purchasing steaks. The main method I use is ordering from a website. I can clearly identify which cut of steak I would like. This store will mainly focus on simplicity and user experience for the customers.

This project will showcase a range of steaks and steak related products for customers to purchase. The site will be clear and easilsy accessible. The best e-commerce stores display simply but clear navgiation around the site, with an intuitive design.

### Project Goals
One of the main goals of the project is to create a simple and intuitive store where customers can purchase steaks and steak related items. Products will be presented in a elegant and easy view. All site users will be able to navigate around the website clearly.

### User Goals:
First Time Visitor Goals
-   As a first-time visitor, I want to easily view all products and details.
-   As a first-time visitor, I want to purchase products based on product ratings and recommendations.
-   As a first-time visitor, I want to be able to checkout as a guest.

Returning Visitor Goals
-   As a returning visitor, I want to create an account.
-   As a returning visitor, I want to update my user profile.
-   As a returning visitor, I want to view my order history.

Frequent User Goals
-   As a frequent user, I want to read up on the latest blog posts.

### User Expectations:
The website should have a simple user interface, with the navigation to each section clear and concise.

-   The menu is clear to read.
-   The user interface is easy to navigate.
-   The website is responsive on all devices.
-   To be able to see a clear selection of products.
-   Easily view the total of the basket before making any payment.
-   The website provides responsive feedback for any actions, for example when adding a product to the basket.

### User Stories
Throughout the project I used the GitHub projects board to log all user stories as my project management tool. This helped me keep focus on the necesarry tasks as I would move them to the "in progress lane" as I'm working on the story. I would then move them to the "done" lane once the story has been completed.
