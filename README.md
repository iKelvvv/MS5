# E-Commerce Store

## Introduction

Welcome to my fifth project. This project is an e-commerce store for steak lovers. Users will be able to purchase steaks and steak related equipment from this website. This project will use languages and frameworks such as Django, Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

In this project I will set up an authentication mechanism and provide access to the site's data for users to purchase a range of products.

The admin of the website will also be have the ability to use all CRUD funtionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

A live website can be found [here](https://kelvin-steakout.herokuapp.com/).

# 1. UX

[Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

As a massive fan of steak, I have always experimented with buying steaks online. There are multiple methods that I use when purchasing steaks. The main method I use is ordering from a website. I can clearly identify which cut of steak I would like. This store will mainly focus on simplicity and user experience for the customers.

This project will showcase a range of steaks and steak related products for customers to purchase. The site will be clear and easilsy accessible. The best e-commerce stores display simply but clear navgiation around the site, with an intuitive design.

### User Stories
Throughout the project I used the GitHub projects board to log all user stories as my project management tool. This helped me keep focus on the necesarry tasks as I would move them to the "in progress lane" as I'm working on the story. I would then move them to the "done" lane once the story has been completed.
