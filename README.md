# E-Commerce Store

## Introduction

Welcome to my fifth project. This project is an e-commerce store for steak lovers. Users will be able to purchase steaks and steak related equipment from this website. This project will use languages and frameworks such as Django, Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

In this project I will set up an authentication mechanism and provide access to the site's data for users to purchase a range of products.

The admin of the website will also be have the ability to use all CRUD funtionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

A live website can be found [here](https://kelvin-steakout.herokuapp.com/).

# 1. UX

[Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

As a massive fan of steak, I have always experimented with buying steaks online. There are multiple methods that I use when purchasing steaks. The main method I use is ordering from a website. I can clearly identify which cut of steak I would like. This store will mainly focus on simplicity and user experience for the customers.

This project will showcase a range of steaks and steak related products for customers to purchase. The site will be clear and easilsy accessible. The best e-commerce stores display simply but clear navgiation around the site, with an intuitive design.

### User Expectations:
The website should have a simple user interface, with the navigation to each section clear and concise.

-   To be able to see a clear selection of products.

### User Stories
Throughout the project I used the GitHub projects board to log all user stories as my project management tool. This helped me keep focus on the necesarry tasks as I would move them to the "in progress lane" as I'm working on the story. I would then move them to the "done" lane once the story has been completed.

- Easy navigation through labelled buttons
- Footer at the bottom of the each page that links to the social media websites, newsletter subscription form and business pages.
- All elements will be consistent including font size, font family, colour scheme.

#### HTML:
I used [W3C Markup](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input+with_options) to check for any errors within the HTML pages.

I had ocurring errors that were related to Django, for these instances I have chosen to ignore them.
![HTML_errors_example](documentation_assets/images/html_error_example.png)

#### CSS:
I used [W3C CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to check for any errors within all my CSS stylesheets.

I had one error in my checkout CSS file, however, I have chosen to ignore this as this code is similar to the Code Institute CSS:
![css_validation_error](documentation_assets/images/static_css_error.png)

I had no errors in my root level CSS file:
![css_validation](documentation_assets/images/static_css_no_error.png)

### JavaScript:
I used [JS Hint](https://jshint.com/) to check for any errors within all my JavaScript script files. JS Hint showed warnings a few warnings but no errors.

I had no errors in my JavaScript files:
![javascript_validation](documentation_assets/images/javascript_validation.png)

### Python:
I used the python3 -m flake8 command within GitPod to check for any errors within my Python files. The validator showed multiple "line too long" errors. This was rectified by adding each statement as a new line.

There were also "line too long" errors within my settings.py file but I have chosen to ignore these as this is a very important file.

3. Open the terminal within GitPod
4. Enter "python3 manage.py runserver into the terminal.

# 6. SEO
[Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

To improve the SearchEngineOptimisation (SEO) of the site I:

- Added keywords in a meta tag to my base.html. The keywords were researched using [WordTracker](https://www.wordtracker.com/), there are a number of short-tail and long-tail keywords.

- This is a list of all the keywords I came up with, steak sauces, juicy steak, bbq, bbq steaks, summer, bbq, barbecue, buy steak, charcoal grill, grill, premium steak, buy steaks online, bbq steaks, steak grill, bbq grill, best steak cuts, premium steak delivery, premium beef cuts, steak marinade, bbq marinade for steak and large charcoal bbq.

- I ended up using these:
    - Premium steak
    - Buy steaks online
    - BBQ steaks
    - Steak grill
    - BBW grill
    - Best steak cuts
    - Premium steak delivery
    - Premium beef cuts
    - Steak marinade
    - BBW marinade for steak
    - Large charcoal bbq

I chose these keywords because they didnt have incredibly high volume and compeition.

# 7. Marketing
[Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

For my marketing strategies I decided to go with the Content marketing, Social media and email marketing root. As these are free options and very effective for an E-commerce store.

- Content marketing - Posting content that contain blog posts and video tutorials will be my primary source to display content.

- Social media - Using these platforms will help build and interact with customers to build relationships and loyaly. This is also help build the brand. Followers will help share the business posts and in results gaining more traction to other people. The same content can be across all social media platforms.

- Email marketing - Using email marking via a newsletter will be beneficial as it is a free source of marketing. Those who are subscribed are more likely to convert into paying customers. This will incerease sales and returning customers as I can provide discount codes and other special offers. A good pro is that the business has total control over the design of the emails.

# 10. Known Bugs
[Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

- The quantity selector for the products had a bug where the minus button was not disabled on mobile devices. This was rectified with CodeInstitute guidance.

- The original free delivery threshold was set to Â£49.99, however I ran into a few issues as it would sometimes not calculate free delivery threshold as it was expecting an integer. This was rectified by changing the free delivery threshold figure to Â£250.

- The google maps iframe sometimes has issue loading on the contact page.
